Here are some ideas about a professional bio:

Identify the audience
Let your audience know why you’re qualified
What makes us unique
Start with a powerful first sentence
Short and to the point
Add personality
Tell a compelling story
Let people know what we offer
Include a call to action
My bio is platform dependent
